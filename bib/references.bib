ABSTRACT = {Currently, new technologies have enabled the design of smart applications that are used as decision-making tools in the problems of daily life. The key issue in designing such an application is the increasing level of user interaction. Mixed reality (MR) is an emerging technology that deals with maximum user interaction in the real world compared to other similar technologies. Developing an MR application is complicated, and depends on the different components that have been addressed in previous literature. In addition to the extraction of such components, a comprehensive study that presents a generic framework comprising all components required to develop MR applications needs to be performed. This review studies intensive research to obtain a comprehensive framework for MR applications. The suggested framework comprises five layers: the first layer considers system components; the second and third layers focus on architectural issues for component integration; the fourth layer is the application layer that executes the architecture; and the fifth layer is the user interface layer that enables user interaction. The merits of this study are as follows: this review can act as a proper resource for MR basic concepts, and it introduces MR development steps and analytical models, a simulation toolkit, system types, and architecture types, in addition to practical issues for stakeholders such as considering MR different domains.},

ABSTRACT = {In recent years, with the rapid advancement and consumerization of virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality, and extended reality (XR) technology, the use of XR technology in spine medicine has also become increasingly popular. The rising use of XR technology in spine medicine has also been accelerated by the recent wave of digital transformation (i.e., case-specific three-dimensional medical images and holograms, wearable sensors, video cameras, fifth generation, artificial intelligence, and head-mounted displays), and further accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the increase in minimally invasive spine surgery. The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on society, but positive impacts can also be expected, including the continued spread and adoption of telemedicine services (i.e., tele-education, tele-surgery, tele-rehabilitation) that promote digital transformation. The purpose of this narrative review is to describe the accelerators of XR (VR, AR, MR) technology in spine medicine and then to provide a comprehensive review of the use of XR technology in spine medicine, including surgery, consultation, education, and rehabilitation, as well as to identify its limitations and future perspectives (status quo and quo vadis).},

ABSTRACT = {The recent advancements in digital technologies have led to exponential progress in dentistry. This narrative review aims to summarize the applications of Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality in dentistry and describes future challenges in digitalization, such as Artificial Intelligence and Robotics. Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Mixed Reality represent effective tools in the educational technology, as they can enhance students’ learning and clinical training. Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality and can also be useful aids during clinical practice. Augmented Reality can be used to add digital data to real life clinical data. Clinicians can apply Virtual Reality for a digital wax-up that provides a pre-visualization of the final post treatment result. In addition, both these technologies may also be employed to eradicate dental phobia in patients and further enhance patient’s education. Similarly, they can be used to enhance communication between the dentist, patient, and technician. Artificial Intelligence and Robotics can also improve clinical practice. Artificial Intelligence is currently developed to improve dental diagnosis and provide more precise prognoses of dental diseases, whereas Robotics may be used to assist in daily practice.},

ABSTRACT = {Simulation-based medical training is considered an effective tool to acquire/refine technical skills, mitigating the ethical issues of Halsted’s model. This review aims at evaluating the literature on medical simulation techniques based on augmented reality (AR), mixed reality (MR), and hybrid approaches. The research identified 23 articles that meet the inclusion criteria: 43% combine two approaches (MR and hybrid), 22% combine all three, 26% employ only the hybrid approach, and 9% apply only the MR approach. Among the studies reviewed, 22% use commercial simulators, whereas 78% describe custom-made simulators. Each simulator is classified according to its target clinical application: training of surgical tasks (e.g., specific tasks for training in neurosurgery, abdominal surgery, orthopedic surgery, dental surgery, otorhinolaryngological surgery, or also generic tasks such as palpation) and education in medicine (e.g., anatomy learning). Additionally, the review assesses the complexity, reusability, and realism of the physical replicas, as well as the portability of the simulators. Finally, we describe whether and how the simulators have been validated. The review highlights that most of the studies do not have a significant sample size and that they include only a feasibility assessment and preliminary validation; thus, further research is needed to validate existing simulators and to verify whether improvements in performance on a simulated scenario translate into improved performance on real patients.},

abstract = { This review aims to identify the role of augmented, virtual or mixed reality (AR, VR or MR) technologies in setting of spinal surgery. The authors address the challenges surrounding the implementation of this technology in the operating room. A technical standpoint addresses the efficacy of these imaging modalities based on the current literature in the field. Ultimately, these technologies must be cost-effective to ensure widespread adoption. This may be achieved through reduced surgical times and decreased incidence of post-operative complications and revisions while maintaining equivalent safety profile to alternative surgical approaches. While current studies focus mainly on the successful placement of pedicle screws via AR-guided instrumentation, a wider scope of procedures may be assisted using AR, VR or MR technology once efficacy and safety have been validated. These emerging technologies offer a significant advantage in the guidance of complex procedures that require high precision and accuracy using minimally invasive interventions. }

abstract = {Background
This review aims to examine the existing literature to address currently used virtual, augmented, and mixed reality modalities in the areas of preoperative surgical planning, intraoperative guidance, and postoperative management in the field of cardiothoracic surgery. In addition this innovative technology provides future perspectives and potential benefits for cardiothoracic surgeons, trainees, and patients.
Methods
A targeted, nonsystematic literature assessment was performed within the Medline and Google Scholar databases to help identify current trends and to provide better understanding of the current state-of-the-art extended reality (XR) modalities in cardiothoracic surgery. Related articles published up to July 2020 were included in the review.
Results
XR is a novel technique gaining increasing application in cardiothoracic surgery. It provides a 3-dimensional and realistic view of structures and environments and offers the user the ability to interact with digital projections of surgical targets. Recent studies showed the validity and benefits of XR applications in cardiothoracic surgery. Examples include XR-guided preoperative planning, intraoperative guidance and navigation, postoperative pain and rehabilitation management, surgical simulation, and patient education.
Conclusions
XR is gaining interest in the field of cardiothoracic surgery. In particular there are promising roles for XR applications in televirtuality, surgical planning, surgical simulation, and perioperative management. However future refinement and research are needed to further implement XR in the aforementioned settings within cardiothoracic surgery.}

abstract = {Background
Immersive technologies like Mixed Reality (MR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are becoming increasingly popular and gain user trust across various fields, particularly in medicine. In this paper we will use the general term Mixed Reality (MR) to refer to the various virtual reality methods, namely VR and AR. These new immersive technologies require varying degrees of instruction, both in their practice use, as well as in how to adjust to interacting with 3D virtual spaces. This study assesses the pedagogical value of these immersive technologies in medical education.
Method
We surveyed a group of 211 students and 47 academic faculty at a medical college regarding potential applications of MR in the medical curriculum by using a questionnaire comprised of eight questions. Results were analyzed accounting for user age and professional position, i.e., student vs faculty.
Results
70% of students and 60% of the academic faculty think that MR-supplemented education is advantageous over a classical instruction. Most highly valued were the 3D visualization capabilities of MR, especially in anatomy classes. There was no significant statistical difference between students and faculty responders. Moreover, screensharing between faculty and students contributed to better, longer lasting absorption of knowledge. Surprisingly, the main issue was related to availability, i.e., only 5% of students had access to MR, while 17% of faculty use MR regularly, and 36% occasionally.
Conclusions
MR technology can be a valuable resource that supports traditional medical education, especially via 3D anatomy classes, however MR availability needs to be increased. Moreover, MR expands the capabilities and effectiveness of remote learning, which was normalized during the COVID-19 pandemic, to ensure effective student and patient education. MR-based lessons, or even select modules, provide a unique opportunity to exchange experiences inside and outside the medical community.}
